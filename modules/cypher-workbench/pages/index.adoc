Cypher Workbench (also known as Solutions Workbench) is a cloud based tool that assists Neo4j developers in creating and maintaining solutions built on top of Neo4j. Cypher Workbench provides support throughout the entire solution development lifecycle from project inception through testing. Additionally, with its reverse engineering, validation, and debugging capabilities, it can be used to introspect existing Neo4j deployments to assist with maintenance, documentation, or troubleshooting.

== Installation

* Check out the code from the https://github.com/neo4j-labs/cypher-workbench[GitHub Repository]
* Ensure that you have https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] on your machine
* Follow the instructions in the Cypher Workbench project README

== Functionality Includes

* *Business Scenarios*. Capture questions and business problems. Start modeling based on your scenarios, and link completed Cypher queries to the scenarios.
* *Model*. Create and edit graph models. Reverse engineer models from existing Neo4j databases and Cypher statements. Supports limited collaboration.Â 
* *Cypher Suite*. Capture sets of related Cypher Statements. Statements can be validated against models and databases. 
* *Reveal*. Run, debug, and explain Cypher execution visually.
* *Cypher Builder*. Build Cypher statements graphically. MATCH statements can be built by clicking on nodes and relationships in the graph model. 
* *Databases*. Configure connections to Neo4j databases.
